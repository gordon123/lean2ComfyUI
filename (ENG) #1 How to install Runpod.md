# lean2ComfyUI  
(*Just starting to learn from general knowledge sources, suitable for beginners who want to explore ComfyUI.*)  

This is a space to collect knowledge that Iâ€™ve picked up from various sources and put together.  
I personally donâ€™t have a powerful computer, so I primarily use cloud services like [runpod.io](https://runpod.io?ref=c0v5p0ys).

## Signing up for Runpod.io  
When using Runpod, you pay based on the computing resources you use per hour.  
I usually go for options that cost around **$0.2 - $0.4 per hour**. Using it for about **6 hours** costs approximately **$2.5 - $3.5 USD (or around 85 THB for 6 hours)**, which is very affordable compared to buying a high-spec PC.  

In exchange, I can generate **high-quality images** using large FLUX models to get the results I want.  

**Important:**  
After finishing your work, make sure to **delete your Pod** so you donâ€™t have to pay for storage fees. Iâ€™ll explain how to manage this later.

### **Steps to Get Started with Runpod.io**
#### 1. **Sign up with Gmail**  
   
#### 2. **Add funds**  
Minimum deposit: **$10 USD**

#### 3. **Select a GPU Cloud instance**

#### 4. **Choose "Community Cloud"**  
- It's usually cheaper.  
- "Secure Cloud" is good too, but demand is higher.  
- If you plan to **rent long-term** or run a **web service**, you might not need to worry about this.  
- This guide is intended for beginners trying Runpod for the first time.  

#### 5. **Select your machine specs**  
Look for a machine with:  
âœ… **VRAM:** 20GB+  
âœ… **RAM:** 60GB+  
âœ… **Price:** $0.5 - $0.2 per hour  

**Speed Categories:**  
- **Low, Medium, High** â†’ Affects download speed for models  
- If you frequently download large models, **choose Medium or High**  
- If only Low is available, itâ€™s still usable  

**2x in GPU names** = Two GPUs  
- I prefer **a single GPU** with **20GB+ VRAM**, as it usually runs faster.  
- Try different options to see what works best for you.

#### 6. **Choose a Template**  
Scroll down to find the **Template button**

I personally use:  
**runpod/pytorch:2.2.0-py3.10-cuda12.1.1-devel-ubuntu22.04**  
- It includes **Jupyter & Web Terminal**, making file management easy.

If youâ€™re comfortable with **Docker**, you can choose another version.  
Since Iâ€™m not familiar with Docker, I prefer **Pytorch - Jupyter**, which works similarly to **Google Colab**.

### **Setting Up the Template**
- **Disk space:** At least **120GB**  
- **Port:** Set **8188** to open **WebUI**
